Overview
--------

This library allows for easier access to Fusion Tables. It contains:

1. Authentication/Authorization mechanisms (OAuth and ClientLogin)
2. SQL builder
3. CSV importer


Authentication/Authorization
----------------------------
This library provides 3 mechanisms for authentication / authorization:
1. ClientLogin
2. OAuth through PHP extension
3. OAuth through 3rd party library


OAuth through PHP extension
---------------------------
To use the OAuth PHP extension, please follow instructions for installation:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/oauth.setup.php


3rd party OAuth library
-----------------------
The following 3rd party OAuth php library was used: 

http://code.google.com/p/oauth-php/

For the full functionality of this library you will need:

PHP 5
Apache extension as getallheaders() is used
libcurl
mysql extension
openssl for RSA-SHA1 support

Initial set-up

The oauth-php library will require some initial set-up, depending on how plan
to use it. The library requires the creation of a store. The store could be 
just the session (not recommended), a mysql database, an oracle database, etc.
If you plan on using the database, you will have to run an install script to create
the appropriate tables in the database. This install script is found within:

./oauth-php/library/store/*

Remove the comments from the appropriate code, enter your own credentials and 
database (if not already created, you will have to create this database), and
run the code. 

Once this is complete, you also need to register your server. Run storeServer
method in OAuthClient. For example:

OAuthClient::storeServer($consumer_key, $consumer_secret, "MySQL", 1, $extra_options);

Setup is complete at this point.
